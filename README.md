# A simple program that receives a list of strings which are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The program also optionally takes a second argument that, when set to 'True', displays the answers alongside the rearranged problems. This program was produced as part of the Scientific Computing with Python course on freeCodeCamp.org. Created by Jacob Hexamer.
